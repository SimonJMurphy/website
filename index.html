<h1>Preparing for TESS</h1>
<h3>March 5-9, 2018 / Flatiron Institute / New York City</h3>

<p>

This workshop (inspired by the <a href="http://gaia.lol">Gaia Sprints</a>) is
designed to bring together a group of people with a common interest in
scientific discovery using data from NASA's forthcoming
<a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS Mission</a>.
This meeting is intended to build new collaborations, minimize duplication of
effort, and facilitate the development of open-source tools for working with
this new dataset.
This is not a traditional scientific conference and there won't be any formal
talks.
Instead, the time will be spent in informal discussions and co-working, with
the goal of having tangible results by the end of the week.
This project is designed to help build and support the broader TESS community,
and we welcome applications from people both inside and outside the TESS
project.

</p>

<h2>Applications are Open</h2>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>

To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the
<a href="http://gaia.lol/codeofconduct.html">collaboration policy developed
for the Gaia Sprints</a>.
This policy requires that participants agree to the following:

</p><p>

All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise, code,
and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open, among
participants and in the world.

</p><p>

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations, and
combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a project
can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any participant
who gets significant contributions to a project is expected to include those
contributors as co-authors.

</p><p>

These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code</i>, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.

</p>

<h2 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate
harassment, abusive behavior, or intimidation of conference participants in any
form. As such, we follow the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of
Ethics</a>, and expect all participants to read and abide by the statements
in the <a href="https://aas.org/ethics">AAS Code of Ethics</a>.
